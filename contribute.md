# Contributing guidelines

It is a noble experience to contribute to this mission of documenting some of the noble products that are making our planet :earth_americas: a better place to live in each day.

To maintain freedom of thoughts and actions, we have kept the rules at a minimum:

* ### Add a product to an existing purpose

In order to do so, _try to_ adhere to the following format:

> [Product name](Product link): A short description of the product. Preferably in a line.

* ### Add a new Product type 

Add the new product type to the end and it should contain at least one product. Additionally, corresponding change should be reflected in the _table of contents_.

* No other rules unless you are happy. :smile:
